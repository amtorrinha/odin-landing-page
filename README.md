# Landing Page
This project consists of a dummy landing page using relatively simple HTML elements and CSS styling.

The main goal was to reproduce the page from a pre-existing design, while respecting the several sections' dimensions, alignments and contents.

I was able to improve my knowledge on the usage of the most common HTML elements, as well as CSS styling techniques, such as the flexbox display.
